# 🌟 Hobby Space  

Welcome to my **Hobby Space**! 🚀 This is where I explore, experiment, and track my learning progress in robotics, reinforcement learning, and brain-computer interfaces.  

## 🛠 Ongoing Learning Projects  
1. **Redoing BCI ALVI Challenge** 🧠  
   - Revisiting past work on this challenge.  
   - Implementing signal processing and classification improvements.  

2. **Gymnasium-Robotics Mini-Project** 🤖  
   - Setting up an entry-level robotics simulation environment.  
   - Implementing and training a reinforcement learning agent.  
   - Analyzing performance and fine-tuning hyperparameters.  

3. **PyTorch for Reinforcement Learning** 🔥  
   - Learning the fundamentals of RL with PyTorch.  
   - Training a policy network for control tasks.  
   - Experimenting with different RL algorithms.
