# EMG-Robotics Project Diary

This diary documents the detailed progress and tasks of the EMG-Robotics integration project.

---
**Focus:** Project Setup & Research Review
- [x] Defined project scope and objectives.
- [x] Created initial GitHub README with goals, paper review, dataset plan, and methodology.
- [ ] Investigated public EMG datasets suitable for integration.
- [ ] Reviewed literature on EMG signal classification and Gymnasium-Robotics use cases.
- [ ] Identified three relevant papers for the review section.

**Notes:**
- No direct literature found combining EMG control with Gymnasium-Robotics. Will structure the project as an exploratory bridge between these two fields.
- Need to select a Gymnasium-Robotics environment (likely 'Reacher' or 'ShadowHand') to begin mapping EMG signals.
---
**Focus:**  Gymnasium-Robotics environment Setup
- [ ] Learn basic of Gymnasium/Gymnasium-Robotics.
- [ ] Build a simple Gymnasium-Robotics environment.
---
**Focus:** Dataset Analysis
- [ ] Select and download public EMG dataset.
- [ ] Perform preliminary exploration of data format and content.
- [ ] Start writing code for signal preprocessing (normalization, filtering).
- [ ] Decide on feature extraction methods (RMS, MAV, etc.).

**Notes:**
- Looking into datasets from Ninapro or EMG datasets on PhysioNet.
- Need to understand signal consistency and usability across subjects.

**Focus:**  Integration
